## Test
It is recommended that you follow this workflow:
```
When you load the portfolio, you should be presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

When you click one of the links in the navigation, then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

When you click on the link to the section about their work, then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.

When you are presented with the developer's first application, then that application's image should be larger in size than others

When you click on the images of the applications, then you are taken to that deployed application. 

When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, then you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewpoint. 
```
