# Professional Portfolio
In this challenge, you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch, 

## User story

* As a employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples, so that I can view samples of their work and access whether they're a good candidate for an open position 

## Acceptance Criteria 

Given I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

* When I load their portfolio, then I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

* When I click one of the links in the navigation, then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

* When I click on the link to the section about their work, then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

* When I am presented with the developer's first application, then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

* When I click on the images of the applications, then I am taken to that deployed application

* When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, then I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
